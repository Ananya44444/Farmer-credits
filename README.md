Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers in India and similar regions face significant barriers when trying to participate in carbon markets. Traditional MRV
(Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) systems are manual, expensive, and designed for large-scale farms, making them inaccessible, slow, and error-prone for
small farmers. Farmers often cannot prove their sustainable practices, leading to lost economic opportunities and limited adoption of climate-friendly agriculture. 
Additionally, delayed or inaccurate verification reduces trust in the carbon credit system, further discouraging participation.

Proposed Solution / Prototype

Our prototype is a web-based MRV platform tailored specifically for smallholder farmers. It allows farmers to log in, input crop yields, and upload receipts, which are
then processed through a multi-layer verification system:

AI/ML Verification: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) extracts key data from receipts, and machine learning models detect anomalies.

Regional & Historical Cross-Check: Submitted yields are compared against regional averages and historical records to ensure plausibility.

Confidence Scoring: Each submission receives a score to determine whether it is automatically approved or flagged for manual review.

Carbon Calculation: Python-based formulas compute the exact carbon impact of verified yields.

Digital Wallet Integration: Verified carbon credits are instantly added to a farmer’s wallet, allowing for trading, redemption, or tracking.

The web interface is built using React.js and JavaScript, with a backend powered by Python (FastAPI) or Node.js, and data is stored in PostgreSQL or MongoDB. Optional 
future enhancements include remote sensing and GIS integration to verify crops at scale.

Key Features

Web and mobile-friendly interface for easy farmer access.

AI/ML-based receipt verification for speed and reliability.

Multi-layer verification using regional and historical yield data.

Python-based carbon calculations for precise credit issuance.

Digital wallet for instant rewards and tracking.

Dashboard analytics for farmers and administrators.

Impact & Advantages

Farmer Empowerment: Smallholders can now participate in carbon markets easily and confidently, earning tangible rewards for sustainable practices.

Accuracy & Fraud Prevention: Multi-layer verification ensures trustworthy and precise carbon credit issuance.

Cost Reduction: Lowers verification costs from $50–$200 per farmer (traditional systems) to $1–$5 per farmer.

Speed & Accessibility: Farmers receive credits in minutes instead of months, making participation highly attractive.

Scalability: The platform can scale across thousands of farmers, and optional remote sensing enables regional or national-level deployment.

Environmental Benefits: Encourages climate-smart farming, reducing emissions and supporting India’s NDC goals.

Key Innovation / Differentiator

The platform’s unique value lies in combining AI/ML verification, multi-layer data checks, and instant wallet-based credit issuance into a single, user-friendly system. 
Unlike traditional MRV solutions, which are manual, costly, and inaccessible to smallholders, this prototype delivers fast, accurate, transparent, and scalable carbon credit management, making sustainable farming practical and rewarding.
